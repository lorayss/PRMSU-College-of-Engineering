                <h3>Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Program was first proposed to be offered in Botolan Campus under the Self-Liquidating Program Scheme in early 2002 under the leadership of President Feliciano S. Rosete. The RMTU Board of Regents approved the proposal in early 2003, but Iba Campus was chosen as its venue due to facilities and faculty availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BSCE had its first batch graduate in March 2008 with a seventy percent passing rate in the board examination. In 2010, the program was transferred to CEA as a regular program. The BSCE received its Certificate of Program Compliance and Level I AACCUP accreditation in 2016 and Level II in 2019.

                <h3>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering began in the 2nd Semester of AY 2001-2002, approved as a self-liquidating program under the Institute of Evening Opportunity Program (IEOP). The first Program Chair was Engr. Juvelyn M. Bueno, with the first batch graduating in 2007.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, the program expanded to morning and evening sessions under the College of Communications and Information Technology (CCIT) and IEOP. In 2018, the program was transferred under the College of Engineering (COE) in compliance with CHED recommendations.
